To understand ajax, lets imagine a page to search for books, built using the techniques we've explored thus far...

To start, we'd have some view with a form like this:

```html
<form method='POST' action='/book/search'>

	{{ csrf_token() }}

	<input type='text' name='searchTerm'>

	<input type='submit' value='Submit'>

</form>
```

The user would enter a search term and hit the Submit button.

The form would submit to the POST route `/book/search`, including the data (`searchTerm`).

The POST route `/book/search/` would receive the data and perform a query against the Book model, retrieving the matching books. Then it could return a view that's prepared to display the books.

For example:
```php
public function postSearch(Request $request) {

    # Do the search with the provided search term
    $books = \App\Book::where('title','LIKE','%'.$request->searchTerm.'%')->get();

	# Return the view with the books
    return view('books.search-ajax')->with('books',$books);
}
```

The view to display the books might like this:

```php
@extends('layouts.master')

@section('title')
    Search results
@stop

@section('content')
	@if(sizeof($books) == 0)
		No results found.
	@endif

	@foreach($books as $book)
		<div class='book'>
			<a href='/book/show/{{$book->id}}'>{{ $book->title }}</a>
		</div>
	@endforeach
@stop
```

The key part of the above interaction is that the entire page submitted in order to fetch the search results. __The purpose of ajax is avoiding this full page request.__

Imagine doing the following actions...

* Posting a comment on your friend's Facebook wall
* Adding an item to a shopping cart from an online store
* Dragging around a Google Map in order to see a new portion of that map

Thinking about these interactions, you'll note that the page does not refresh each time you trigger the action (submit comment, add to cart, drag map).

Instead, data is sent to the server &ldquo;behind the scenes&rdquo;, the server returns a response, and the existing page is updated to let you know your action was successful.

This is ajax&mdash; __a technique that allows a site to communicate with its server (and the server to respond), even after the page has completed loading__. This means your user can invoke small actions throughout your page and get near-immediate feedback with no page load required.



## Technical definition
Ajax stands for **Asynchronous JavaScript** and **XML**. It's not one single technology but actually a combination of technologies.

Let's break down the different pieces:

**Asynchronous** describes the &ldquo;behind the scenes&rdquo; nature of ajax. Data is transferred from the browser to the server, all behind the scenes without interrupting other requests on the page. This is in contrast with *synchronous*, where the browser is effectively frozen while a request is being processed.

**JavaScript** is in charge of sending the data from the browser to the server, commonly using a browser API called the [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest)). In addition to sending the request, JS is in charge of receiving and processing any data returned from the server.

**XML** stands for *Extensible Markup Language* and it's describing the format of the data that's sent back from the server. XML is similar to HTML in that it's a tag based language, but it's made specifically for transferring data between machines. All that being said, you don't have to use XML as your data protocol. It's common to have the server respond with JSON, HTML or other formats.



## Example
<img src='http://making-the-internet.s3.amazonaws.com/laravel-ajax-search-for-books.gif'>

Demo:
+ <http://foobooks.dwa15-practice.biz/book/search>
+ Login with `jill@harvard.edu` / `helloworld`

Here's a rundown of the essential pieces of how this is working:

Two routes:
```php
Route::get('/book/search', 'BookController@getSearch');
Route::post('/book/search', 'BookController@postSearch');
```

The first route (GET) is to show a search form.

The second route (POST) will respond to the ajax call requesting books.


## GET /search/book - Show form to search for book
For the GET route, set up the BookController@getSearch method so that it returns a view called `search.blade.php`

```php
public function getSearch() {
	return view('books.search');
}
```

The `books.search` view should be created (`/resources/views/books/search.blade.php`) and include the following contents:
```php
@extends('layouts.master')

@section('title')
    Search for a book
@stop

@section('head')
    <link href='/css/search.css' rel='stylesheet'>
@stop

@section('content')

    <h1>Search for a book</h1>

    <form method='POST'>

        {{ csrf_field() }}

        <div class='form-group'>
           <label>Search for a book title, e.g. 'Gatsby' or 'Caged Bird':</label>
            <input
                type='text'
                id='searchTerm'
                name='searchTerm'
            >
            <span id='loading' style='display:none'>Loading...</span>
        </div>

        <h2>Results:</h2>
        <div id='results'></div>

    </form>

@stop

@section('body')
    <script src="/js/search.js"></script>
@stop
```

Note the following points about the above view:
+ There's a form with a csrf token, and a text input for the `searchTerm`.
+ There's an empty div with the id `results`; this is where results from the ajax call will be written to.
+ There's a span with the id `loading` and the text `Loading...` that is set to be invisible on page load. Your JS will make this span visible when waiting for an ajax response, and then invisible when the response is complete.
+ A file `/js/search.js` is included at the bottom. The JS to handle the ajax call will go in that file; we'll come back to it in a moment.


## POST /search/book - Responds to ajax request for books
The POST action uses `searchTerm` from the request data, performs a query on the Book model, and returns a view called `books.search-ajax`.

That code looks like this:

```php
/**
* Responds to requests to POST /book/search/
* This method is used in response to an ajax request from GET /book/search
* See /public/js/search.js
*/
public function postSearch(Request $request) {

    # Do the search with the provided search term
    $books = \App\Book::where('title','LIKE','%'.$request->searchTerm.'%')->get();

	# Return the view with the books
    return view('books.search-ajax')->with(
        ['books' => $books]
    );
}
```

You'll note the above method returns the view `books.search-ajax`, so the next step is to create that.

Create `/resources/views/books/search-ajax.blade.php` with this code:

```html
@if(sizeof($books) == 0)
    No results found.
@endif

@foreach($books as $book)
    <div class='book'>
        <a href='/book/show/{{$book->id}}'>{{ $book->title }}</a>
    </div>
@endforeach
```

Note how this view loops through `$books`, which it'll receive from the controller.

Also note how it's a fragment template&mdash; it does not extend the master layout. That's because this view is not intended to be used in isolation, but as an ajax response that JavaScript will inject into the `#results` div.



## The JavaScript
At this point you have a GET route to show the form, and a POST route to respond to requests from the form, now we just need JavaScript to make those requests.

Create `/public/js/search.js` and fill it with this code:

```js
// We don't want the form to actually submit if the user hits the Enter key
$('form').submit(function(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
});

// The following anonymous function will trigger every time the key goes up
// in the search input; i.e. someone changes the search input.
$('#searchTerm').keyup(function() {

    // Set up the ajax call; see http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax for more details
    $.ajax({
        url: '/book/search', // Route that will handle the request; its job is to return us books.
        method: 'POST',
        dataType : 'html', // Kind of data we're expecting to get back
        data: { // Two pieces of data we'll send with the request
            '_token': $('input[name=_token]').val(),
            'searchTerm': $('#searchTerm').val()
        },
        // What to do before each ajax
        beforeSend: function() {
            $('#loading').show();
            $('#results').removeClass('error');
        },
        // What to do upon completion of a successful ajax call
        success: function(data) {
            $('#loading').hide();
            $('#results').html(data);
        },
        // What to do upon completion of an unsuccessful ajax call
        error: function() {
            $('#results').html('Sorry, there was an error; your request could not be completed.');
            $('#results').addClass('error');
        }

    });

});
```

In order for this code to work, your page needs to include jQuery. In foobooks, jQuery is included via the [master template](https://github.com/susanBuck/foobooks/blob/master/resources/views/layouts/master.blade.php#L63).

Read through the JavaScript for `search.js`, as it's commented to explain what is going on. If you're unfamiliar with JavaScript, you might find this code challenging to understand. Feel free to ask myself or a TA for further explanation as needed.


## Summary
Those are all the pieces needed to make this work... Now lets run through what happens:

+ You visit `http://localhost/book/search` and see a search form.
+ You start typing into the search box, which triggers the `keyup` event listener in your `search.js` file.
+ The event listener executes the ajax call, which sends a request via POST to `http://localhost/book/search`. The request includes the search term.
+ `postSearch()` receives the request and queries the Book model with the given search term.
+ Resulting books are passed to a view, which is then returned.
+ Now the ajax call receives this response, and injects it into the `#results` div on the page.
